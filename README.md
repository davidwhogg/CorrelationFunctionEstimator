## Comments
- Estimator generalized by thinking about the relationship between correlation-function estimation and linear fitting.
- New estimator can be used to simultaneously estimate power spectrum and correlation function in one shot.
- Also can be used to extract Fisher-information-saturating sufficient statistics for cosmological-parameter estimates.
- Originally designed to look for gradients in cosmological power with respect to position, density, or other model-breaking anomalies.
